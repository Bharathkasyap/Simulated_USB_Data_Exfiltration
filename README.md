### üß© Key Differences:

| Feature                        | Microsoft Sentinel Detection Rules                  | Microsoft Purview DLP Rules                             |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal**                      | Detect malicious/suspicious activity via logs       | Prevent sensitive data from leaving organization        |
| **Based on**                  | KQL queries on ingested logs (Defender, Sysmon, etc.) | Predefined policies, content inspection (e.g., SSNs, PII) |
| **Trigger Type**              | Reactive alert when a condition is matched          | Proactive: Prevents file sharing/sending if match found |
| **Use Case**                  | Catch abnormal behavior like USB exfiltration       | Stop SSN/email being sent externally                   |
| **Tooling**                   | Azure Sentinel + Defender Logs                      | Microsoft Purview + Microsoft Defender for Endpoint     |
| **Response**                  | Create Incident ‚Üí Alert ‚Üí Manual/Playbook           | Quarantine, block, encrypt, notify                      |

## ‚úÖ Insider Threat Scenario: USB Data Exfiltration by Contractor

### üß† Scenario Summary:
A short-term contractor (employee-1257) attempted to exfiltrate confidential data such as HR records and financial documents by copying them to a USB drive. Due to limited access, no real-time DLP prevention tools like Microsoft Purview were available. However, the attempt was successfully detected through custom KQL rules in Azure Sentinel, showcasing a strong understanding of detection methodologies and proactive security monitoring.

### üö® Alert Trigger:
A custom detection rule in Microsoft Sentinel analyzes events from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

### Alert triggered on:

- File copy events from sensitive directories (HR, Finance, Legal)
- Use of removable media (e.g., D:\Staging)
- Match with sensitive filename patterns (e.g., Employee_SSN.docx)

**Actor:** Known temp account with elevated file access

**[For Simulation Steps](src/simulation.md)**

### üß™ Analyst Investigation:
Investigated the Sentinel alert using Advanced Hunting queries against DeviceFileEvents

### üìÑ Rule Location:
Microsoft Sentinel

**Analytics Rule Name:** USB_Sensitive_File_Copy_Detection

**Data Source Table:** DeviceFileEvents

### üß† KQL Detection Logic:

```kusto
DeviceFileEvents
| where ActionType == "FileCopied"
| where AdditionalFields contains "RemovableMedia"
| where FileName has_any ("SSN", "credit", "HR", "finance", "Confidential")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, FileName, FolderPath, ActionType
```
---


### üìå Explanation:

- ActionType == "FileCopied": Focuses only on actual data movement.
- RemovableMedia: Ensures USB is involved.
- Filename filter: Triggers only if files suggest sensitive content.
- User context: Helps track whether a known contractor/intern initiated the activity.

### üîó Alert was auto-generated by:
This Sentinel detection rule ran every 5 minutes and matched the above KQL condition. The match occurred once the file Q2_Report.pdf was copied to the USB.


### üß† How the Analyst Received the Alert

- Microsoft Sentinel ‚Üí Incidents pane
- Alert was visible in the active incidents with severity "High".
- Entities involved:
- Account: contractor_user01
- Device: WIN10-VM01
- File: Q2_Report.pdf

---

### Alert Workflow (automated):

- Triggered a Sentinel analytics rule.
- Automatically created an incident.
- Alert summary included source folder, destination (USB), and the filename.
- Email/Teams notification was sent to SOC team (if SOAR playbook enabled).


```kusto
DeviceFileEvents
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName == "contractor_user01"
| where FolderPath has_any ("HR", "Finance", "Confidential")
| where AdditionalFields contains "RemovableMedia"
| project Timestamp, FileName, FolderPath, ActionType
```

### üß† Hypothesis

"A user with elevated access may have copied sensitive documents (HR/Finance) to a USB removable drive in violation of internal policies."

### üõ†Ô∏è Environment Prerequisites

- Microsoft Sentinel connected to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
- DeviceFileEvents data source enabled
- Sysmon configured and running on the endpoint
- Endpoint (e.g., Windows 10 VM) simulates internal user behavior

### üîç Step-by-Step Threat Hunt Process

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Narrow Search to USB Write Events

We begin by looking for file copy actions to USB media.

```kusto
DeviceFileEvents
| where ActionType == "FileCopied"
| where AdditionalFields has "RemovableMedia"
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Add Filters for File Sensitivity

Add filename filters to detect high-value data (HR, Finance, SSNs, etc.)

```kusto
| where FileName has_any("HR", "SSN", "Finance", "Employee", "Salary", "Report")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, FileName, FolderPath, ActionType
```

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Identify Risky User Accounts

Hone in on contractor or intern accounts.

```kusto
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName in~ ("employee-1257", "contractor_user01")
```

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Observe File Destination Path

Check if copied files went to D: or other removable drive letters.

```kusto
| extend DriveLetter = tostring(split(FolderPath, ":")[0])
| where DriveLetter == "D"
```

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Detect Obfuscation or Renaming

Check if sensitive file content was renamed with misleading names.

```kusto
| where FileName has_any("payment_details", "image", "backup", "info")
```

---

### üìå Additional Techniques

- Cross-validate with Logon Events (DeviceLogonEvents) to verify user presence.
- Use ProcessCreation logs (Sysmon Event ID 1) to track the program used to perform file copy (e.g., Explorer.exe, cmd.exe).
- Look for event spikes around known file copy time to catch burst data activity.

---

### üì§ Output & Hunting Dashboard

- Save query as a Hunting Rule in Sentinel
- Set frequency: Every 1 hour
- Output: Alert if ‚â• 2 files match pattern from contractor within 10 minutes

---

### üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Initial Analyst Response (Tier 1/Tier 2)

- Opened alert ‚Üí Clicked on ‚ÄúInvestigate‚Äù tab.
- Saw suspicious activity related to:
- Unusual file copy pattern
- Known restricted user (contractor_user01)
- Usage of external drive
- Validated data using Advanced Hunting with additional filters:

---

### ‚úÖ Final Goal of This Threat Hunt

- Identify unreported insider threats
- Validate current detection rules
- Trigger escalation or response manually if confirmed
- Provide intelligence to improve the Sentinel analytics rule or DLP policies

---

## ‚úÖ Incident Response Flow

- **Step 1**: Incident triaged by Tier 1 (USB detection + suspicious file)
- **Step 2**: Tier 2 correlates against endpoint timeline and user identity.
- **Step 3**: Device isolated or user session terminated (if configured).
- **Step 4**: IOC (filename hash/path) sent to Defender or TI team.
- **Step 5**: Final review & documentation stored in case manager.

### Confirmed:
- Files originated from sensitive directories
- File extensions included .pdf, .docx, .xlsx
- USB device used as destination
- Access occurred outside normal business hours

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Root Cause:
- No Microsoft Purview DLP rules were available in this setup to prevent data transfer to USBs.
- Detection was post-event, highlighting a gap in proactive controls.
- Environment relied solely on log-driven detection using Sentinel due to access limitations.

### üßØ Containment Steps:
- Endpoint isolated using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's isolate device command
- USB device ID added to blocklist in Endpoint Manager
- Contractor account disabled; HR & legal teams notified
- Playbook triggered for forensic collection and incident documentation

### üõ†Ô∏è Improvement & Automation:
### üö´ Initial Setup:
- No data-centric DLP tools available (like Microsoft Purview)
- Only reactive detection using Azure Sentinel analytics rules

### ‚úÖ Strategic Enhancements Based on Learnings:
### üß† Simulated Microsoft Purview DLP Understanding Applied:
- Documented how a real DLP policy would‚Äôve prevented this (USB block, content inspection)
- Created DLP-style detection rule logic using KQL for educational value
- Mapped use case to Microsoft Purview's functionality to show readiness for real-world DLP implementation

### üìà KQL Detection Rule Enhanced:
- Filtered for DeviceFileEvents involving removable drives
- Flagged file transfers with sensitive naming conventions
- Escalated alerts automatically for accounts tagged as temporary or contractors

### ‚öôÔ∏è SOAR Integration via Sentinel:
- Playbook triggered on detection
- Sent email to SOC
- Created ticket in ServiceNow
- Isolated the host if USB transfer exceeded threshold

### ‚úÖ Final Outcome:
Even in the absence of Purview DLP, this incident proved that Sentinel-based detection and SOC response can mitigate insider threats effectively. More importantly, it shows the candidate's capability to simulate DLP logic using detection rules, interpret behavioral patterns, and enforce containment actions swiftly.

### Before:

- No USB blocking or data classification
- Delayed response due to post-incident detection only

### After:

- Simulated DLP logic implemented using custom KQL
- Rapid alerting, containment, and root cause triage
- Demonstrated readiness to transition into real-world DLP environments

### üéØ Key Message:
Even without direct access to Microsoft Purview DLP, this scenario proves my strong grasp of DLP principles, incident detection strategy, and SOC response workflows. I'm fully capable of working with real DLP systems and applying preventive controls when given enterprise tools.

### Let's simulate the setup of the DLP tool Purview
