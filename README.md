### üîç Why This Section?
Before diving into the simulated insider threat scenario, it's important to understand the **difference between detection rules in Microsoft Sentinel** and **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies in Microsoft Purview/Defender**.

---

### üß© Key Differences:

| Feature                        | Microsoft Sentinel Detection Rules                  | Microsoft Purview DLP Rules                             |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal**                      | Detect malicious/suspicious activity via logs       | Prevent sensitive data from leaving organization        |
| **Based on**                  | KQL queries on ingested logs (Defender, Sysmon, etc.) | Predefined policies, content inspection (e.g., SSNs, PII) |
| **Trigger Type**              | Reactive alert when a condition is matched          | Proactive: Prevents file sharing/sending if match found |
| **Use Case**                  | Catch abnormal behavior like USB exfiltration       | Stop SSN/email being sent externally                   |
| **Tooling**                   | Azure Sentinel + Defender Logs                      | Microsoft Purview + Microsoft Defender for Endpoint     |
| **Response**                  | Create Incident ‚Üí Alert ‚Üí Manual/Playbook           | Quarantine, block, encrypt, notify                      |

### üõ†Ô∏è What You‚Äôll Learn in the Simulation

- How **Sentinel detection rules** are written using **KQL**
- How those alerts are used to identify risky behavior
- How the simulation evolved into **automated prevention using DLP**
- Full lifecycle from **alert ‚Üí investigation ‚Üí automated remediation**

# üîê Simulated USB Data Exfiltration using Sysmon + Sentinel

## üß≠ Objective
To simulate an insider threat scenario where a user creates or copies sensitive files to a staging location before exfiltrating via USB. Using Sysmon + Microsoft Sentinel, we demonstrate how such events are logged, queried, and analyzed.

---

## üìÅ Simulated Folder Activity
**Monitored Path**: `D:\Staging`  
**File Types Observed**: `.docx`, `.pdf`  
**Example Filenames**: `finance_notes.pdf`, `backup_policy.docx`, `meeting_summary.pdf`

---

## üìä Sysmon Configuration Used
Sysmon Rule: [sysmonconfig.xml](https://github.com/Bharathkasyap/Email_Security_Simulation_Azure/blob/main/sysmonconfig.xml)  
Captured Events:
- File Created
- File Renamed (optional enhancement)
- File Copied (if enabled)

---

## üìã Example KQL Query Used in Sentinel
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where FolderPath startswith "D:\\Staging"
| where FileName has_any("finance", "summary", "backup", "project")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, FileName, FolderPath, ActionType
| order by Timestamp desc
```

- [TA0010 ‚Äì Exfiltration](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0010/)

---

## üîç Alerting Process

1. Analyst receives incident notification via Sentinel (Email or UI alert).
2. KQL detection fires upon file creation in target directory.
3. File names & paths reviewed in **DeviceFileEvents** logs.
4. SOC correlates with user identity & endpoint session history.
5. Escalation initiated if policy breached.

---

## ‚úÖ Incident Response Flow

- **Step 1**: Incident triaged by Tier 1 (USB detection + suspicious file)
- **Step 2**: Tier 2 correlates against endpoint timeline and user identity.
- **Step 3**: Device isolated or user session terminated (if configured).
- **Step 4**: IOC (filename hash/path) sent to Defender or TI team.
- **Step 5**: Final review & documentation stored in case manager.

**Project Title: Simulated USB Data Exfiltration Detection using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Sentinel**

---

### üîç Objective

This project simulates an **insider threat scenario** where a contractor attempts to exfiltrate sensitive files (e.g., SSNs, finance documents) via a USB drive. The goal is to:

* Demonstrate **data loss prevention (DLP)** using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
* Detect unauthorized file access and copy activity using **Sysmon logs** and **KQL queries** in Microsoft Sentinel
* Document governance policies and playbook workflows following **industry standards**
* Align all steps with the **MITRE ATT\&CK framework**, the **United Airlines Insider Threat JD**, and **SOC triage procedures**

---

### üè¢ Scenario Summary

A contractor on a short-term project accesses files labeled "Internal Use Only" and transfers them to a USB drive. The files contain sensitive financial or personal information.

* Device: Windows 10 VM (Employee-1257)
* File Types: `.docx`, `.pdf` containing SSNs, budget, payment info
* Intent: Covert exfiltration for personal gain or sabotage

---

### ü§¶Ô∏è Step-by-Step Implementation

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Configure Sysmon with USB & File Monitoring

* Used `sysmonconfig.xml` from SwiftOnSecurity
* Installed Sysmon on the endpoint:

  ```powershell
  Sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig.xml
  ```
* Enabled Event ID 11 (FileCreate), Event ID 1 (ProcessCreate), and Event ID 3 (NetworkConnect)

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: Simulate USB File Copy

* Files like `Employee_SSN.docx`, `payment_notes.pdf`, `internal_budget.docx` created in `C:\HR`
* Files copied to `D:\Staging` to simulate removable media
* Files renamed as `finance_notes.pdf`, `meeting_summary.pdf`

#### ‚úÖ Step 3: Use Event Viewer to Confirm Sysmon Logs

* Location: `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon > Operational`
* Observed file creation and rename events with metadata

#### ‚úÖ Step 4: Log Ingestion in Sentinel

* Events forwarded to Microsoft Sentinel
* Table: `DeviceFileEvents`
* Logs tagged with:

  * DeviceName: employee-1257
  * ActionType: FileCreated/FileRenamed

#### ‚úÖ Step 5: KQL Detection Logic

```kusto
DeviceFileEvents
| where FolderPath startswith "D:\\Staging"
| where FileName has_any("finance", "summary", "backup", "project")
| where ActionType == "FileCreated" or ActionType == "FileRenamed"
| extend User=InitiatingProcessAccountName
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, User, FileName, FolderPath, ActionType
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### üöí Incident Response Steps

1. **Detection Triggered** via Sentinel custom rule
2. **Email/Portal Notification** received by analyst
3. **Playbook Run**: Triage + ticket generated
4. **Investigate Device Logs**: Search for matching filenames, users
5. **Alert Escalation**: Notify HR or Insider Threat Team
6. **Remediate**: Block USB access, isolate machine
7. **Document**: IOC report, user behavior, timeline

---

### üîí Prevention Governance Policies (Documented)

* USB access limited to encrypted devices
* High-risk roles like interns/contractors blocked from removable media
* Sentinel alert thresholds defined in markdown
* MITRE coverage validated for audit readiness

## üßë‚Äçüíº Insider Threat Scenario: USB Data Exfiltration (Contractor)
<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand and view incident timeline</strong></summary>

### üïµÔ∏è Scenario Summary:
A short-term contractor attempted to exfiltrate sensitive internal documents using a USB storage device. This user had temporary access to HR and finance reports, and suspicious file transfers triggered alerts in our DLP system.

---

### üö® How the Alert Was Triggered:
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detected large file access on a removable USB device.
- Sentinel triggered a **DLP Analytics Rule** using KQL that looked for keywords like:
  `"SSN"`, `"Employee"`, `"backup"`, `"finance"`, `"notes"`
- The alert was assigned a severity of **High** and routed to Tier 1 SOC Analyst.

---

### üîç Analyst Investigation:
- Used **Advanced Hunting** in Microsoft 365 Defender to inspect `DeviceFileEvents` logs.
- Confirmed access to files with confidential naming patterns (`Employee_SSN.docx`, `finance_notes.pdf`).
- File transfers occurred within a short timeframe and originated from a machine registered to the contractor.
- **Confirmed this was not accidental behavior** but intentional staging and file renaming before copying.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Incident Containment:
- The host machine was **isolated from the network** immediately using Defender isolation commands.
- SOC team blocked
