## ‚úÖ Insider Threat Scenario: USB Data Exfiltration

A contractor attempts to copy confidential HR and finance files to a USB drive. Our Sentinel detection rules trigger alerts based on log behavior, identifying this as a policy violation. However, because detection occurs **after** the attempt, it creates a gap in prevention.

To solve this, we implemented a simulated DLP policy using Microsoft Purview to **block** such actions **before** data exfiltration occurs. This shows the practical value of combining Sentinel detection with Purview prevention in real environments.

### üîç Why This Section?
Before we dive into the simulated USB data exfiltration case, it's important to highlight why relying only on **detection rules like those in Microsoft Sentinel** isn‚Äôt enough. **Detection identifies threats after the damage begins.** This is why we extended this project with a full simulation of Microsoft Purview DLP, a preventive tool that actively stops data loss before it happens.

| **Goal**                      | Detect malicious/suspicious activity via logs       | Prevent sensitive data from leaving organization        |
| **Based on**                  | KQL queries on ingested logs (Defender, Sysmon, etc.) | Predefined policies, content inspection (e.g., SSNs, PII) |
| **Trigger Type**              | Reactive alert when a condition is matched          | Proactive: Prevents file sharing/sending if match found |
| **Use Case**                  | Catch abnormal behavior like USB exfiltration       | Block exfiltration before it leaves the system          |
| **Tooling**                   | Azure Sentinel + Defender Logs                      | Microsoft Purview + Microsoft Defender for Endpoint     |

## üß™ Detection Rule in Sentinel: USB File Copy Alert

### üéØ Goal:
Detect potential data exfiltration by monitoring USB file copy events involving sensitive HR and finance documents.

### Tools Used:

| Component                             | Role                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Microsoft Sentinel                    | Alerting based on KQL rules                              |
| Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) | Provides DeviceFileEvents data                           |
| Sysmon + Event Viewer                 | Monitors file system activities                          |
| KQL                                   | Custom logic for identifying suspicious file transfers   |

### üîç KQL Detection Logic:

```kusto
DeviceFileEvents
| where ActionType == "FileCopied"
| where AdditionalFields contains "RemovableMedia"
| where FileName has_any("SSN", "Finance", "HR", "Confidential")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, FileName, FolderPath
```

**Alert Triggered For:**
- User: `contractor_user01`
- Device: `employee-1257`
- File: `Q2_Report.pdf` copied to `D:\Staging`

**Outcome:**
Sentinel created a high-severity alert. Tier 1 SOC triaged the alert, and Tier 2 confirmed exfiltration indicators. However, no preventive action occurred until after the copy was complete.

---

## üö´ Sentinel Limitation

Detection was accurate but **not preventive**. The file was already on the USB drive when the alert triggered. This revealed a gap in protection ‚Äî exposing how Sentinel can only **see** the violation after it starts, not stop it.

---

## ‚úÖ Microsoft Purview DLP Enforcement Simulation

To address this gap, we built and simulated a Microsoft Purview DLP policy to enforce **real-time protection**.

### Goal:
Block file transfers containing PII or financial data from being copied to removable media by unauthorized users (contractors, interns, etc.).

### Simulated DLP Policy Details:

| Policy Name                         | USB_ConfidentialData_Block_Policy              |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Target Devices                     | Windows 10/11 endpoints with Defender onboard  |
| Monitored Content                  | SSNs, credit card numbers, HR/Finance terms    |
| Action                             | Block file transfer, notify user and SOC       |
| Exceptions                         | Security_Admins, Whitelisted_Contractors       |

**Result:**
When the contractor attempted the same file copy under this policy:
- Transfer was blocked before writing to USB
- User received a warning with policy details
- SOC was alerted with policy match context
- No data left the device

| Isolates endpoint         | Manual if configured                     | Manual or automatic via SOAR                |

## üéØ Final Outcome & Takeaway

This project demonstrates the **need to go beyond detection**. While Sentinel detection rules are powerful for visibility and triage, they cannot **prevent** a data breach alone.

By implementing Microsoft Purview‚Äôs DLP policies, we:
- Blocked sensitive data transfers at runtime
- Closed the prevention gap in our SOC strategy
- Delivered both reactive alerts and proactive enforcement
