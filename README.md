### üß© Key Differences:

| Feature                        | Microsoft Sentinel Detection Rules                  | Microsoft Purview DLP Rules                             |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal**                      | Detect malicious/suspicious activity via logs       | Prevent sensitive data from leaving organization        |
| **Based on**                  | KQL queries on ingested logs (Defender, Sysmon, etc.) | Predefined policies, content inspection (e.g., SSNs, PII) |
| **Trigger Type**              | Reactive alert when a condition is matched          | Proactive: Prevents file sharing/sending if match found |
| **Use Case**                  | Catch abnormal behavior like USB exfiltration       | Stop SSN/email being sent externally                   |
| **Tooling**                   | Azure Sentinel + Defender Logs                      | Microsoft Purview + Microsoft Defender for Endpoint     |
| **Response**                  | Create Incident ‚Üí Alert ‚Üí Manual/Playbook           | Quarantine, block, encrypt, notify                      |

## ‚úÖ Insider Threat Scenario: USB Data Exfiltration by Contractor

### üß† Scenario Summary:
A short-term contractor (employee-1257) attempted to exfiltrate confidential data such as HR records and financial documents by copying them to a USB drive. Due to limited access, no real-time DLP prevention tools like Microsoft Purview were available. However, the attempt was successfully detected through custom KQL rules in Azure Sentinel, showcasing a strong understanding of detection methodologies and proactive security monitoring.

### üö® Alert Trigger:
A custom detection rule in Microsoft Sentinel analyzes events from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

### Alert triggered on:

- File copy events from sensitive directories (HR, Finance, Legal)
- Use of removable media (e.g., D:\Staging)
- Match with sensitive filename patterns (e.g., Employee_SSN.docx)

**Actor:** Known temp account with elevated file access

**[For simulation Steps](src/simulation.md)**

### üß™ Analyst Investigation:
Investigated the Sentinel alert using Advanced Hunting queries against DeviceFileEvents

### Confirmed:

-Files originated from sensitive directories
-File extensions included .pdf, .docx, .xlsx
-USB device used as destination
-Access occurred outside normal business hours

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Root Cause:
- No Microsoft Purview DLP rules were available in this setup to prevent data transfer to USBs.
- Detection was post-event, highlighting a gap in proactive controls.
- Environment relied solely on log-driven detection using Sentinel due to access limitations.

### üßØ Containment Steps:
- Endpoint isolated using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's isolate device command
- USB device ID added to blocklist in Endpoint Manager
- Contractor account disabled; HR & legal teams notified
- Playbook triggered for forensic collection and incident documentation

### üõ†Ô∏è Improvement & Automation:
### üö´ Initial Setup:
- No data-centric DLP tools available (like Microsoft Purview)
- Only reactive detection using Azure Sentinel analytics rules

### ‚úÖ Strategic Enhancements Based on Learnings:
### üß† Simulated Microsoft Purview DLP Understanding Applied:
- Documented how a real DLP policy would‚Äôve prevented this (USB block, content inspection)
- Created DLP-style detection rule logic using KQL for educational value
- Mapped use case to Microsoft Purview's functionality to show readiness for real-world DLP implementation

### üìà KQL Detection Rule Enhanced:
- Filtered for DeviceFileEvents involving removable drives
- Flagged file transfers with sensitive naming conventions
- Escalated alerts automatically for accounts tagged as temporary or contractors

### ‚öôÔ∏è SOAR Integration via Sentinel:
-Playbook triggered on detection
-Sent email to SOC
-Created ticket in ServiceNow
-Isolated the host if USB transfer exceeded threshold

### ‚úÖ Final Outcome:
Even in the absence of Purview DLP, this incident proved that Sentinel-based detection and SOC response can mitigate insider threats effectively. More importantly, it shows the candidate's capability to simulate DLP logic using detection rules, interpret behavioral patterns, and enforce containment actions swiftly.

### Before:

-No USB blocking or data classification
-Delayed response due to post-incident detection only

### After:

- Simulated DLP logic implemented using custom KQL
- Rapid alerting, containment, and root cause triage
- Demonstrated readiness to transition into real-world DLP environments

### üéØ Key Message:
Even without direct access to Microsoft Purview DLP, this scenario proves my strong grasp of DLP principles, incident detection strategy, and SOC response workflows. I'm fully capable of working with real DLP systems and applying preventive controls when given enterprise tools.

# üîê Simulated USB Data Exfiltration using Sysmon + Sentinel

## üß≠ Objective
To simulate an insider threat scenario where a user creates or copies sensitive files to a staging location before exfiltrating via USB. Using Sysmon + Microsoft Sentinel, we demonstrate how such events are logged, queried, and analyzed.

---

## üìÅ Simulated Folder Activity
**Monitored Path**: `D:\Staging`  
**File Types Observed**: `.docx`, `.pdf`  
**Example Filenames**: `finance_notes.pdf`, `backup_policy.docx`, `meeting_summary.pdf`

---

## üìä Sysmon Configuration Used
Sysmon Rule: [sysmonconfig.xml](https://github.com/Bharathkasyap/Email_Security_Simulation_Azure/blob/main/sysmonconfig.xml)  
Captured Events:
- File Created
- File Renamed (optional enhancement)
- File Copied (if enabled)

---

## üìã Example KQL Query Used in Sentinel
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where FolderPath startswith "D:\\Staging"
| where FileName has_any("finance", "summary", "backup", "project")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, FileName, FolderPath, ActionType
| order by Timestamp desc
```

- [TA0010 ‚Äì Exfiltration](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0010/)

---

## üîç Alerting Process

1. Analyst receives incident notification via Sentinel (Email or UI alert).
2. KQL detection fires upon file creation in target directory.
3. File names & paths reviewed in **DeviceFileEvents** logs.
4. SOC correlates with user identity & endpoint session history.
5. Escalation initiated if policy breached.

---

## ‚úÖ Incident Response Flow

- **Step 1**: Incident triaged by Tier 1 (USB detection + suspicious file)
- **Step 2**: Tier 2 correlates against endpoint timeline and user identity.
- **Step 3**: Device isolated or user session terminated (if configured).
- **Step 4**: IOC (filename hash/path) sent to Defender or TI team.
- **Step 5**: Final review & documentation stored in case manager.

### ü§¶Ô∏è Step-by-Step Implementation

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Configure Sysmon with USB & File Monitoring

* Used `sysmonconfig.xml` from SwiftOnSecurity
* Installed Sysmon on the endpoint:

  ```powershell
  Sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig.xml
  ```
* Enabled Event ID 11 (FileCreate), Event ID 1 (ProcessCreate), and Event ID 3 (NetworkConnect)

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: Simulate USB File Copy

* Files like `Employee_SSN.docx`, `payment_notes.pdf`, `internal_budget.docx` created in `C:\HR`
* Files copied to `D:\Staging` to simulate removable media
* Files renamed as `finance_notes.pdf`, `meeting_summary.pdf`

#### ‚úÖ Step 3: Use Event Viewer to Confirm Sysmon Logs

* Location: `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon > Operational`
* Observed file creation and rename events with metadata

#### ‚úÖ Step 4: Log Ingestion in Sentinel

* Events forwarded to Microsoft Sentinel
* Table: `DeviceFileEvents`
* Logs tagged with:

  * DeviceName: employee-1257
  * ActionType: FileCreated/FileRenamed

#### ‚úÖ Step 5: KQL Detection Logic

```kusto
DeviceFileEvents
| where FolderPath startswith "D:\\Staging"

## üßë‚Äçüíº Insider Threat Scenario: USB Data Exfiltration (Contractor)
<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand and view incident timeline</strong></summary>

### üïµÔ∏è Scenario Summary:
A short-term contractor attempted to exfiltrate sensitive internal documents using a USB storage device. This user had temporary access to HR and finance reports, and suspicious file transfers triggered alerts in our DLP system.

---

### üö® How the Alert Was Triggered:
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detected large file access on a removable USB device.
- Sentinel triggered a **DLP Analytics Rule** using KQL that looked for keywords like:
  `"SSN"`, `"Employee"`, `"backup"`, `"finance"`, `"notes"`
- The alert was assigned a severity of **High** and routed to Tier 1 SOC Analyst.

---

### üîç Analyst Investigation:
- Used **Advanced Hunting** in Microsoft 365 Defender to inspect `DeviceFileEvents` logs.
- Confirmed access to files with confidential naming patterns (`Employee_SSN.docx`, `finance_notes.pdf`).
- File transfers occurred within a short timeframe and originated from a machine registered to the contractor.
- **Confirmed this was not accidental behavior** but intentional staging and file renaming before copying.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Incident Containment:
- The host machine was **isolated from the network** immediately using Defender isolation commands.
- SOC team blocked
